# Identifying_organisational_childrens_homes_ratings
This is a repository of data and reproducible code to show how data has been aggregated to identify the summed children's homes ratings for all for-profit companies and third sector organisations from 2014 to 2022. This data will support some upcoming work which will be linked here, with full attributions to the author, when released.

 - Final data is available in the 'Final_data' folder.
 - Raw data used by the code is available in the 'Raw_data' folder.
 - Code used to create the final datasets are available in the 'Code' folder.
 - Raw data is downloaded from original publications from Ofsted, most recently [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/childrens-social-care-data-in-england-2022) from the full collection [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/childrens-social-care-statistics).
 
The code to clean the data directly pulls raw data from this repository so it should be entirely reproducible after any new-to-you R packages have been downloaded. I've tried to comment it fully, any issues let me know...
